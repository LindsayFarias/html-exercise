    <p>
        I've lived my whole life in Texas, from growing up in small town Brenham, TX to attending college at Texas State University in San Marcos, TX.
        While attending college I jumped from apartment to apartment, living in a vairety of different towns. 
        My senior year of college I decided to join my college's Air Force ROTC program, and from there I got sent to my first duty station at Patrick Space Force Base in Satellite Beach, FL.
        The journey is to continue soon as I am slotted to move to my next base June of 2022, destination unknown (for now)!

    I've travelled all over the United States, but have yet to make my way over to Europe. If asked to generate a top ten list of cities I'd like to visit, all of my destinations would be in Europe.
    I am hopeful I will get to make a trip over soon!
